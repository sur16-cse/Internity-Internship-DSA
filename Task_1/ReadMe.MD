## **1. What is data.**

The term data means a value or set of values. It specifies either the value of a variable or a constant (e.g., marks of students, name of an employee, address of a customer, value of pi, etc.)



## **2. What is data structures.**

A data structure is basically a group of data elements that are put together under one name, and which defines a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.  



Data structures are generally categorized into two classes: primitive and non-primitive data structures.

Primitive data structures are the fundamental data types which are supported by a programming language. Some basic data types are integer, real, character, and boolean. The terms ‘data type’, ‘basic data type’, and ‘primitive data type’ are often used interchangeably. 
Non-primitive data structures are those data structures which are created using primitive data structures. Examples of such data structures include linked lists, stacks, trees, and graphs.


Non-primitive data structures can further be classified into two categories: linear and non-linear data structures. 

linear: sequential order follow. eg- arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

non linear: not follow sequential order. eg- Trees, Graphs.  



## **3. What is abstract data types.**  

An abstract data type (ADT) is the way we look at a data structure, focusing on what it does and ignoring how it does its job.

For example, stacks and queues are perfect examples of an ADT.

We can implement both these ADTs using an array or a linked list. This demonstrates the ‘abstract’ nature of stacks and queues.

To understand more clearly, break this term into part "abstract" and "data types".

abstract- Abstract The word ‘abstract’ in the context of data structures means considered apart from the detailed specifications or implementation
Need of data structures in real life.

data types- Data type Data type of a variable is the set of values that the variable can take.  



## **4.Need of Data structure in real life**

Data structures are used in almost every program or software system. Some common examples of data structures are arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, binary trees, and hash tables. Data structures are widely applied in the following areas:

-- Compiler design 

-- Operating system

--Statistical analysis package 

--DBMS

-- Numerical analysis 

--Simulation

--Artificial intelligence 

-- Graphics    



**Real life examples:-**

-- Internet Browser

-- game development

-- fixed keywords which are refernced very frequently

-- store customer order information

-- facebook or in social networking

-- printer functioning  




## **4. Revise the concepts of C++**

Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:  


**Cpp Oops concept :-**

-- Object

-- Class

-- Inheritance

-- Polymorphism

-- Abstraction

-- Encapsulation

-- Data hiding
